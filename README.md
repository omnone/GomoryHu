# GomoryHu

An implementation of the  [Gomory-Hu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomory%E2%80%93Hu_tree) algorithm as proposed by Dan Gusfield and using [LEDA](http://www.algorithmic-solutions.com/index.php/products/leda-for-c) library. We use Gomory-Hu tree algorithm in order to solve all-pair minimum cut problem for a given directed graph. In this example , we also use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm for finding the maximum flow between two nodes. In order to run the project you can use the makefile.
